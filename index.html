<h4>Right to Access, Edit, and Remove Your Information</h4>
    <p>You have a right to access personal information we hold about you. Whenever you use our Site or Globemallow.io Services, we strive to make sure that the Personal Information is correct. If that information is wrong, we give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before making any changes. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. Because we protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, even after information is deleted from the Globemallow.io Services, it may not be immediately deleted from Globemallow.io’s servers. To request removal of your Personal Information from our Site, Services, blog or social media, contact us at help.globemallow [at] gmail.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
    <p>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security. We will comply with laws applicable to us in respect of any data breach.</p>
    <p>If a User interacts with one of our Customers and the User seeks to access, or correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data or no longer wants to be contacted by one of our Customers, the User should direct its inquiry to the Customer because the Customer is the data controller.</p>
    <h4>Disclaimer Google Analytics</h4>
    <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyse how visitors use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
    <h3>Security Measures</h3>
    <p>We take measures to enhance the security of our Site and the Globemallow.io Service. These measures include using SSL Certificates. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. No security measures are perfect and we cannot promise that the information about you will remain secure in all circumstances.</p>
    <h3>Do Not Track Signal</h3>
    <p>We treat the data of everyone who comes to our site in accordance with this Privacy Policy, whatever their Do Not Track setting.</p>
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <p>We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information about children under 13.</p>
    <h3>How Globemallow.io Collects Information?</h3>
    <p>Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by the websites you visit and the emails you read and can be used to help recognize you when you return to a website, or when you visit other sites. We, or third party service providers, may use cookies to, among other things, measure activity, personalize your experience, remember your viewing preferences, or track your status or progress when accessing our site. For some of these purposes, our cookies may be tied to Personal Information and/or Potential PII. In particular, the Globemallow.io Services use first-party cookies to maintain a coherent scope for a user session across multiple pages on a single website. These cookies do not track the same user across unrelated domains and, as described above, attempts to infer identity across domains is strictly prohibited.</p>
    <p>Local Storage is a standard facility provided by HTML5-compliant browsers used to retain data on your computer across visits to the same website. We use local storage as a temporary holding area for user events that were observed locally but, due to the timing of a page unload, were unable to be transmitted as part of the user session. Return visits to the same website read and transmit events previously stored in local storage to complete previously recorded sessions.</p>
    <p>This information may in the aggregate identify a User, however we will not identify a User as they browse the web if the User turns off cookies, as explained below.</p>
    <p>Globemallow.io does not and will not ever attempt to identify the same person across disparate, unrelated domains. It is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy for our customers to attempt to build multi-site user profiles for the intent of selling or exchanging lists of users or demographic information.</p>
    <h3>Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>You always retain the right to withhold personal information from us, with the understanding that your experience of our website may be affected. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights over your personal information. If you do provide us with personal information you understand that we will collect, hold, use and disclose it in accordance with this privacy policy. You retain the right to request details of any personal information we hold about you.</p>
    <p>If we receive personal information about you from a third party, we will protect it as set out in this privacy policy. If you are a third party providing personal information about somebody else, you represent and warrant that you have such person’s consent to provide the personal information to us.</p>
    <p>If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time. We will provide you with the ability to unsubscribe from our email-database or opt out of communications. Please be aware we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity.</p>
    <p>If you believe that we have breached a relevant data protection law and wish to make a complaint, please contact us using the details below and provide us with full details of the alleged breach. We will promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing, setting out the outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint. You also have the right to contact a regulatory body or data protection authority in relation to your complaint.</p>
    <h3>Blocking Cookies</h3>
    <p>If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. Note that turning off cookies may also disable functions of many websites you visit. If your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, Globemallow.io will not be able to coalesce your anonymous user identity automatically into sessions across pages on the same website.</p>
    <h3>Limits of Our Policy</h3>
    <p>Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and policies of those sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy practices.</p>
    <h3>Changes</h3>
    <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. When there are changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update this page. The date above will always indicate when we last made changes. If you are a visitor to this Site and disagree with the Privacy Policy, you should leave the Site and/or cancel your agreement with Globemallow.io.</p>

  <h3>Page Load Time</h3>
  <p>Reducing your page load time can improve the energy required to render pages. Decreasing page load time can improve your SEO; which enables users to find the content they're looking for- faster. Google Search prioritizes pages with faster page load time. Decreasing load time improves the user experience for users with slower connection speeds.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Page Size</h3>
  <p>Reducing Transfer Data size is largely seen as one of the best ways to make your website more sustainable. Caching reduces the server load and the amount of data transferred, making websites more environmentally friendly. When more data is cached, less is transmitted and fewer server requests, pages are loaded much faster. Analytics and advertising script files can add significant weight, increase CPU usage, and slow websites down. Choose plugins that minimize server load and don’t add unnecessary weight on the front end. If you notice little difference between Total Byte Size, and Transfer Size it might mean that additional data can be cached. Transfer Size is the most heavily weighted metric in your Sustainability Grade. Reducing it will increase your Grade if decreased. If Transfer size is greater than 1MB- it's equivalent to 150,000 words in a HTML File. Are your images worth 1,000 words?</p>

  <br>
  <h3>JS HeapSize</h3>
  <p>JavaScript impacts website efficiency by adding file weight to the web page. Increasing the amount of processing required by your device. JavaScript is processed on the your computer/phone requiring CPU usage, which in turn increases the energy consumption of the device. The amount of javascript having to be executed can isolate users with older devices, or smaller processors.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Green Hosted</h3>
  <p>Green Hosted is powered by the Green Web Foundation who defines the dataset as: "the largest dataset in the world of which sites use renewable power." Powering your site with renewables saves energy from energy produced by fossil fuels.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Redirects</h3>
  <p>Redirects are an unnecessary use of resources. It causes additional data to be loaded.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>Cookies are sent with every request, so they can worsen performance (especially for mobile data connections). Are all these cookies on your page necessary? Do you know the specific purpose of each cookie on your page?</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Empty URL Tags</h3>
  <p>Having an empty href link is bad practice. Browser will call the directory in which the page is located if SRC Attribute is empty. This results in additional HTTP requests.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Caching</h3>
  <p>HTTP caching can speed up your page load time on repeat visits. Caching is great for sustainability since it prevents browsers from requesting all resources every time. A longer cache duration is not always better. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what the optimal cache duration is for your resources.</p>
  <br>
    
  <h2>Design</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>Page HTML</h3>
  <p>Page HTML counts the number of bytes on your page from HTML code. If it is significantly high- it can signal that there is too much content on your page. Is there any way to reduce the amount of content on this page? Have you considered just loading content on scroll? If content is being loaded beyond what the user is currently seeing, it is as waste of data.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Lazy Loaded Images</h3>
  <p>With "lazy loading", files are only loaded when they reach the visible area of the browser window, or shortly before it. Modern browsers allow to insert loading=“lazy“ as an attribute in the img element. Lazy loading is useful because it allows images lower on a page to not be loaded if it's not in immediate view. Looking for the following Lazy-Loading methods: loading="lazy", class="lozad", class="b-lazy", class="lazyloaded", and class="lazy".</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Image Formats</h3>
  <p>On most websites, images are the single largest contributors to page weight.The more images you use and the larger those image files, the more data needs to be transferred, increasing the energy that is used. Ask yourself, can my site be using Vector Imagery? Vector images are a cool, clean way to show icons. Could you use a vector graphic (or CSS styling) instead of a photo? The svg format is ideal for simple graphics without a high level of detail, such as icons and geometric representations. Try to do some research on emerging image file formats: WebP and Avif have a greatly reduced amount of data load. Most modern browsers support using the WebP format. It looks great for photographic images, and have a smaller byte size. WebP images typically have about a 30% smaller file size than JPEG. The newer file type AVIF can almost be half the file size of WebP depending on the image.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Responsive Images</h3>
  <p>If a site is being loaded on tablet or smart phone it wastes data to load the same image you would on a desktop website. You can save bandwidth and speed up page load times by loading the most appropriate image for the viewer's display. Our scan is searching for the HTML "picture" tag, and for "srcset" when loading an image for different screen dimensions. Responsive web design has changed how websites can be created. Device detection is no longer needed to display separate “mobile” sites whenever the server detects a phone or tablet. Using srcset or picture HTML allow an image to be displayed at the correct dimensions for a user's device. If media queries are being used in the CSS to create responisve images you want to make sure that not all images are being downloaded at the same time.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Internal Style Sheet</h3>
  <p>Make sure CSS files are separate from page’s HTML code. If CSS is in the HMTL body then the code must be sent for each page request- increasing the amount of data sent. If CSS is in separate files, the browser can store them in local cache.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Style Sheets</h3>
  <p>Reducing unnecessary files will help with overall page size. Reducing the number of CSS files reduces the number of HTTP requests that are required on page load. Ask yourself, can I just combine my multiple Style Sheets into one?</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Background Color</h3>
  <p>Color choices play a role in making websites and other digital tools more or less energy efficient. A study conducted by Google showed: White: uses nearly 20% more power than blue. Blue uses 25% more power than Green or Red. Green and red use a very similar amount of power as one another. Black will use the least amount of power on OLED screens. An easy way to increase your grade is to allow users a 'night mode' that allows them to toggle between a white and black screen.</p>
